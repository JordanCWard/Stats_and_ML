# Statistics & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of statistical analyses and machine learning models implemented in Python. The projects demonstrate foundational and advanced techniques across supervised learning, unsupervised learning, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation, with an emphasis on interpretability, performance metrics, and real-world datasets.

The work highlights the application of statistics and machine learning to practical problems, including customer satisfaction prediction, sales analysis, clustering, and hypothesis testing.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into Jupyter notebooks and datasets, grouped by modeling approach and statistical technique.

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on statistical analysis and machine learning that apply core methods to real-world datasets. Each project emphasizes understanding data, building models, and interpreting results rather than deploying solutions.

## Supervised Learning Projects

### Decision Tree  
Predicts airline customer satisfaction using historical flight experience survey data to understand factors influencing satisfaction.

### Binomial Logistic Regression  
Analyzes airline customer satisfaction survey data to model the likelihood that a passenger reports being satisfied.

### Random Forest Model  
Uses survey responses from airline customers to predict satisfaction and compare performance against simpler classification models.

### XGBoost Model  
Applies gradient boosting to airline satisfaction data to evaluate predictive performance and feature importance.

### Naive Bayes Model  
Examines NBA rookie performance statistics to estimate whether a player will have a career lasting five or more years.

## Regression Analysis

### Linear Regression  
Explores the relationship between radio promotion budget and sales outcomes.

### Multiple Linear Regression Analysis  
Analyzes a small business’s marketing promotion data to understand how multiple advertising channels relate to sales.

### Evaluating Simple Linear Regression  
Evaluates the relationship between TV advertising spending and sales using statistical significance and model diagnostics.

## Unsupervised Learning

### K-means Clustering Model  
Analyzes biological and environmental data to identify patterns within penguin populations using clustering techniques.

## Statistical Testing & Inference

### One-Way ANOVA and Post Hoc Comparison via Tukey’s HSD  
Examines whether sales differ significantly across categories of TV promotional budgets and influencer sizes.

### t-test  
Uses Environmental Protection Agency air quality data to evaluate differences in mean AQI across regions and states to support policy considerations.
