# Statistics & Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of statistical analyses and machine learning models implemented in Python. The projects demonstrate foundational and advanced techniques across supervised learning, unsupervised learning, hypothesis testing, and model evaluation, with an emphasis on interpretability, performance metrics, and real-world datasets.

The work highlights the application of statistics and machine learning to practical problems, including customer satisfaction prediction, sales analysis, clustering, and hypothesis testing.
