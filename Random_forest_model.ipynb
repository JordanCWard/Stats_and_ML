        "This analysis focuses on predicting customer satisfaction using survey responses from 129,880 airline customers. The dataset includes customer demographics, travel characteristics, and service quality ratings such as class, flight distance, and inflight entertainment. The objective is to build a classification model that accurately predicts whether a customer is satisfied with their flight experience.\n",

Model performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure balanced evaluation and appropriate handling of false positives and false negatives."

        "The tuned Random Forest model demonstrated strong predictive performance across all evaluation metrics and outperformed the tuned Decision Tree model in most cases. The model achieved more than 94.2 percent accuracy, with precision above 95 percent and recall of approximately 94.5 percent. These results indicate both reliable positive predictions and effective identification of satisfied customers.\n",

        "Precision was the strongest of the four metrics, showing that the model makes very few false positive predictions. The Random Forest also achieved a higher F1 score than the Decision Tree, indicating better overall classification performance when balancing precision and recall. Based on these results, the tuned Random Forest model is the preferred approach for predicting customer satisfaction."

These insights can be shared with stakeholders to support data-driven decisions aimed at improving the customer experience.\n",

These efforts will help translate model results into actionable business insights."
